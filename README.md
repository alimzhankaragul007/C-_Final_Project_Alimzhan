This code allows students to enter their refrigerator ingredients and get information about what dish they can make.
To use it, first download the "ikt" file, then open it in Visual Studio and run it. When the code runs, you will have three options:
1. Show All Recipes
2. Enter My Ingredients
3. Find What To Cook
And by entering the required ingredients, you will get the dish you can make from them.
